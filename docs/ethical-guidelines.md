- Training materials must be provided to all participants
- Results must be used constructively for organizational improvement
- No punitive measures should be taken against simulation participants

**Implementation**:
```python
# All campaigns require educational justification
campaign_data = {
    "purpose": "Security Awareness Training",
    "educational_objectives": ["Improve phishing detection", "Enhance reporting behavior"],
    "follow_up_training": "Mandatory security awareness session"
}
```

### 2. Informed Consent

**Requirements**:
- General notification about ongoing security improvement initiatives
- Clear policies regarding security testing and awareness training
- Opt-out mechanisms where legally and practically feasible
- Transparent communication about the purpose and scope of testing

### 3. Minimization of Harm
**Principle**: Simulations should minimize psychological, professional, and organizational harm.

**Requirements**:
- Proportional response - simulations appropriate to the target audience
